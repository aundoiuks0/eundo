```
flesh out a simple router with secure api access to configuration methods for the following paradigms:
  - creation of multiple segmented rtables
  - creation of ipsec tunnels
  - simple interface for access control
  - default tacacs integration
  - default bcp38 compliance
  - default deny all
  - default synproxy for all tcp traffic
project will limit itself to being a securing L4 firewall/router
much of the base openbsd distribution as of 6.8 is already in a secure state for host deployment
with a little work lets make a default secure L4 firewall
```
